This sensor simulates 3 different noes and is derived from
the xmpl_linbuf_tx example.
The node just sends frames like

n: 0x0004, t: 26
n: 0x0002, t: 15
n: 0x0005, t: 44

like Axels proposal.

NOTE: The Makefile ist pre-configures for the stb230 board right now.


To receive the frames just use the xmpl_linbuf_rc and connect the USB cable to the
to the host PC.
Use testserver2.py to visualize the 3 different nodes.

run as:

 python testserver2.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0

or whatever port is used.


avrdude -P usb -p m1281 -c dragon_jtag  -U flash:w:bin/sensorapp_fake1_stb230.hex
