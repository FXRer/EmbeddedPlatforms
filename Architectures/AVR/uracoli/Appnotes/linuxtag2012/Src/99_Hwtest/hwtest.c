/*
 * The purpose of this software is to verify the assembled printed
 * cicuit board (PCB) works as designed.
 *
 * For that reason, the LED matrix is cycled through different display
 * patterns.  LEDs that have not been soldered correctly, or IO ports
 * that have no connection to the LEDs can easily be seen.
 *
 * As the LED matrix must be multiplexed in order to work, the
 * multiplexing is performed by 8-bit timer 0 as in the actual
 * application.  The basic code for this has been copied in from the
 * application.
 *
 * Timer 5 is setup for a 500 ms turnover (2 Hz), to cycle through the
 * LED patterns.  Some of the LED patterns are kept for more than one
 * timer tick, most of them change each 500 ms.  This is done by a
 * state machine implemented in the interrupt service routine (ISR)
 * for timer 5's "compare match" event.
 *
 * Timer 4 is setup for a 10 ms turnover (100 Hz), and is used to
 * toggle the auxiliary IO pins.  This affects all the port pins that
 * are not used to drive the LED matrix (including pins that are used
 * for input pads on the resistive or capacitive board versions,
 * respectively).  The main purpose is to verify the portpins have
 * been soldered correctly.  All these pins are configured as output
 * pins, and then switch a certain pattern.  When an internal counter
 * (within the ISR) turns over to 0, all portpins are reset to low
 * value.  On subsequent invocations of the interrupt, portpins are
 * turned high again, starting with pin 0 of each port (thus forming a
 * low pulse lasting only 10 ms), up to pin 7 of each port (thus
 * forming a low pulse lasting 80 ms, followed by a 10 ms high pulse).
 * Each portpin then generates pulses with a period of 90 ms but
 * different duty cycle.  That way, shortcuts between neighbouring
 * portpins can be detected on the oscilloscope, as the generate a
 * "stair" pulse rather than a clear low->high transition.
 *
 * The ISRs for timer 0 and timer 5, respectively, have been made
 * interruptible (keyword ISR_NOBLOCK), in order to give the pulse
 * generation of timer 4 effectively the highest priority.  This
 * avoids jitter when monitoring the auxiliary portpin signals on an
 * oscilloscope.
 *
 * Finally, while toggling through the LED patterns, the transceiver
 * block is activated and deactivated.  While active, it transmits
 * just a CW signal.  This allows to check the basic transceiver
 * functionality: if something is wrong with the 16 MHz crystal, the
 * transceiver will fail to start, and the test gets stuck at that
 * point.  By monitoring the transmitted signal on a test receiver
 * (for example, a spectrum analyzer, but even a different transceiver
 * in receive mode would do), the resulting signal strength must be in
 * the expected range.  If not, something could be wrong with the
 * antenna pins, or the supply pins that are only examined by the
 * analog circuitry of the transceiver.
