proto:
- Protocol to signal CAN-Errors via CANdongle and to set BusState (on, off, listen only)
- CAN-Errors to  Syslog 
- timestamping is incompatible to can4linux (we have struct timeval to get a

caracad:
-socket permissions via parameter
-document protocol
-avoid blocking, if listeners are too slow
