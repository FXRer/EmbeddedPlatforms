This document helps you (and me) understand the architecture of the 
caraca daemon.
Hopefully it will help you get jump-started when you want to make
modifications.

caracad
-------

Server-process, accepts connections via unix-sockets and reads can-messages.
See caracad_test.pl for an example of the used protocol.

See candim.c if you prefer to write handlers in plain c. NOT DONE YET

Every client can install filters and will receive only matching messages from
the server.
Client can send messages directly to the can-bus.
