CARACA - CAn Remote Automation and Control with the AVR, Version: 0.5.0

CARACA is a home automation project based on a net of connected programmable 
circuits suited to perform different tasks like switch on/off appliances, 
decode commands from Ir remote control units, control thermostats, measure 
temperature and more. Every node of the net communicate each other through 
a robust protocol (CANBus), and the status can be monitored by a PC possibly 
connected to the Internet.

Don't expect much documentation. This is only a pre-release version
and there is still much to be done before CARACA becomes easily
configurable and usable.
