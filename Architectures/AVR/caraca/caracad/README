This is still an alpha release.


Concept:
    To allow different applications read/write access to the CAN-Bus, a
    daemon (caracad) is used. A client can connect to it via a socket
    and tell caracad, which messages it wants to receive. (it installs a
    filter - 'I want to have all key messages, all messages of one room,..'
    caracad then sends a message to each listener.
    All clients send their messages to caracad, which transmits them over
    the serial line.
     
    So the following is possible:
    - cron-scripts collecting environmental data (via RTR) or by filtering
      messages from periodically transmitting sensors
    - control programs with your IR remote via LIRC from every room
    - cgi-scripts for ...
    - inserting/debugging/removing modules without affecting other modules

This release includes the following components:
    A Daemon (caracad) to 
    Dimmer support (caracadim)
    A client library for easy interfacing with caracad.
    Perl support modules and examples.
     
    Graphical CAN-Terminal (gcanterm) for bus monitoring and  to send messages
