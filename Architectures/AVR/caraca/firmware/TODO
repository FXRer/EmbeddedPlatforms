ALL:
-CANBus thread need more test for arbitration, syncronization and
 error frames [Claudio]

-Makefile needs automatic dependancies [Claudio]

-Consider to port CARACA to avr-as (gnu binutils), since AVA seems
 to be no more supported [Claudio]

NODE:
-event for long keypress and keyrepeat [Claudio]

STAR:
-Write timer events handling + RTC code [Claudio]

NODE_SKR
-implement "dimming for heating": x waves on, then y waves off [Konrad]
-use analog inputs inputs [Konrad]
    Msg to initialize analog input (no pullup etc)
    Msg to read analog input
    Msg to transmit analog input every n seconds?


CANDONGLE:
-hangs, when CAN-Msg arriving during startup. Maybe problem with node,
 because nobody ack's
-I suggest to add framing to CANBus messages over the serial line.
 There is two state: FRAMEMODE, COMMANDMODE
 We use three special chars: FRAMEINIT, FRAMEEND, ESCAPE. Within a frame
 every special char is replaced by ESCAPE+Char.
 Every frame encapsulate a CANBus message, while commands configure candongle,
 report error messages, etc. [Claudio]
 [Konrad]: Message has a fixed design, dont need escape
